1@The Fool@It’s about to get all new beginnings and fresh start around here.  Are you ready to change your path?  Tired of hanging on to all that old crap?  Put your baggage behind you and take that leap like a true balla.  Situations call for optimism, faith, and fearlessness.  Original thinking.  Beware of the biters at your heels but do what you gonna do anyway. Jump in, no parachute required.  Thinking of a world tour?  Do it, dawg.
2@The Fool Reversed@Why you being a fraidy cat?  Change is inevitable and it’s time to embrace it.  Sure, there is some unknown stuff ahead but why cling to that old familiar crud that you know sucks the life out of you?  Time to gather your courage muscles and make that move.  The old way isn’t hip anymore.  In fact, it’s not doing a thing for you.  That being said, nothing wrong with scoping out the scenario before you dive in.  Looking before you leap could prevent some bullshit later on. Hold back but don’t hold on.  Other wise advice: stop acting the fool.  Grow up.
3@The Magician@The Magician is the card of talent and power.  You’ve got the mad skillz to accomplish your goals at this time.  It’s time to make the most of your abilities. Know that you have everything you need to manifest whatever it is you have in mind.  Your tools are right at your fingertips.  Proceed with total confidence and find the magic within yourself now.  Met a new person?  Chemistry and pure animal attraction.  Prepare for some hot action.
4@The Magician Reversed@Not ready for prime time.  You don’t have your shit together at this time.  Better to pull back and wait until you are absolutely ready.  Jump in without the right knowledge and you risk blowing it and looking like a newbie.  Take your time to develop yourself more.  This card can also signal an abuse of power.  Don’t be a dick.
5@The High Priestess@The High Priestess is all about trusting that killer instinct you have within yourself.  Got a hunch about something? Go with it.  This is time to really listen to your gut.  Before making a decision of power, look within and seek out the answers.  They are there.  You don’t need confirmation from anyone but your own divine self.  This card is also about keeping secrets.  If someone confides in you, keep that dirt on the down-low.
6@The High Priestess Reversed@You’ve lost touch with your own mojo. Time to get back to the source.  Turn off the outer noise so that you can hear the inner voice.  Bad vibes.  This is not the time to reveal your top-secret plans.  Too many big mouths around you – or maybe you got the loose lips?  Bitches can be snitches.
7@The Empress@This beautiful card indicates that a period of great creativity is ahead.  Whether that be creating art, a new life, a new venture, or a child, this is a marker that all signs are a go.  The energy of the Empress is abundant – the wheat field at her feet suggests a good harvest in the future.  When discussing relationships, this card can indicate marriage.  This is one of the best indicators of pregnancy – in a reading asking about motherhood not only can this indicate conception but also the ability and readiness to be a good parent.
8@The Empress Reversed!@A lack of abundance or fertility issues.  Unexpected or problem pregnancy.  Whoops.  In a reading about marriage, this can indicate problems ahead.  Creative blocks.  Issues with mom (aka Mommie Dearest!).  Turning into mom (not necessarily a bad thing – unless your mom is Joan Crawford). Baby momma drama.  Helicopter parenting.  Let your kid breathe and just be a kid, eh?
9@The Emperor@The Emperor represents stability, order, and dominion. When this stern fellow shows up in your reading, issues of power and control may be at play.  This is one of my favorite cards to see when asking about business success – it indicates achievement through hard work and discipline.  Often the Emperor can represent dealings with authority figures – whether that represents your boss or dear old dad, it’s all about R-E-S-P-E-C-T for da man.  If you’re the one in that power position?  Time to boss up and command respect.  Don’t be a square.  (PS this is a positive indicator for marriage too!)
10@The Emperor Reversed@Uh oh – here we go from order to disorder, from power to power trippin’, from authority to tyranny.  What seems secure turns oppressive and shaky.  A coup may be possible.  Now is the time to get your act together, to work towards stability.  Get the ego out of the way and get down to some serious business.  Weak leadership leads to weak sauce in any endeavor.  If this represents a male in your life, he could be a total control freak.  Run.
11@The Hierophant@It may be best to follow the established rules at this time.  Don’t rock the boat – instead, go with tradition.  Feeling confused about a situation?  A visit to a wise counselor or teacher can help you sort that stuff out.  Sometimes a spiritual perspective is what you need to get back on track.  Been really bad? Get your arse to confession and stop that nonsense.  Often The Hierophant can indicate a religious ceremony like a wedding or baptism – so if your honey is acting reluctant, be patient.  You may get to that altar in due time.
12@The Hierophant Reversed@Time to fight the man! Conformity goes out the window and a new order is ready to rumble into place.  Question EVERYTHING. Don’t accept the standard way.  This is time for revolution, even if only a personal inward one.  Break the rules and think for yourself.  Problems with authority.  Feeling like an outcast in your tribe.  Rebellion.  Originality. Don’t be a biter.
13@The Lovers@Who doesn’t like to see love in the forecast?  I sure do as I’m a romantic at heart.  The Lovers can often indicate a relationship coming into your life.  Although this is usually romantic in nature, it can be any sort of relationship where good communication is involved.  If you are considering getting involved with someone for love or business, this is a hell yeah!  This card can also indicate a choice.  When making a choice, follow your heart but be sure you are looking at what option is best for your highest good.
14@The Lovers Reversed@You give love a bad name.  Divorce, breaking up, emotional chaos.  Reverse this card and things become murky and unstable.  If you are asking about love, this may be suggesting a need for counseling and/or reevaluating where the relationship is going.  If you are faced with a difficult decision, now is not the time to be impulsive.  Best to take your time and be mindful about what you want.  I have often seen this card represent a choice with regrets. It don’t have to be that way, homie.  Think before you act.
15@The Chariot@Things are progressing.  The reigns are firmly in your hands and you can move ahead with confidence.  It’s time to put the past in your rear view mirror and stay focused on the road ahead.  Not sure where you are going?  Investigate more than one path if you please.  In time, it will become clear as ice.  You got this, dawg.  In the market for some new wheels?  Whatcha waiting for – go on and get ‘em.
16@The Chariot Reversed@Your overconfident nature is about to bite you in the arse.  Moving ahead without a plan or clue.  Things are getting out of control and you need to pull it together or face complete chaos.  This reversal can also indicate getting stuck – whether that be stagnancy or simply being a stick in the mud, it’s not cool.  Control freaks. Car problems and travel issues.
17@Strength@The appearance of the Strength card often indicates an ability to transcend the obstacles around you through your inner strength.  No matter what you are facing, know that you have the power within to master the issue.  Applied willpower leads to results.  Your strength may be tested now – stay the course and don’t lose hope.  Strength can also indicate taming the animal desires.  Your vices can be controlled – it’s up to you.  Sometimes this card can also indicate taking control and shutting some shit down.  Time for a smackdown!
18@Strength@You’ve lost it, dawg.  Things may be spiraling out of your control.   Get your act together.  Submitting to the situation at hand or giving up.  Fear takes over.  Struggles for control or dominance.  Who’s really in charge?  Stand up for yourself – don’t be weak sauce. Know when to shut yo trap.
19@The Hermit@In order to get the answers you seek, it may be time to turn inward.  Shut out your distractions so that you may discover the wisdom within.  Answers are rarely found in another – everything you need is within yourself.  This card can also indicate a need to withdraw from circumstances in order to get a better perspective.  Sometimes a player needs a break from the grind.
20@The Hermit@Repeating your past mistakes.  Not learning.  This can indicate a lack of wisdom. Doing things without thinking of the consequences.  It can also indicate the extremes of solitude – like being some sort of creepy recluse.  Don’t lock yourself away.  It gets mighty lonely on that mountain top.
21@The Wheel of Fortune@A major change for the better is in the works.  If you have been toiling away, the Universe is now ready to move things in your favor.  Whether this be luck or simply the consequences of past decisions, know that everything is turning and moving.  Momentum is gathering. The Wheel of Fortune is a sign that everything is moving in divine order.
22@The Wheel of Fortune Reversed@What goes up, must come down.  A downturn.  Getting stuck in a major rut.  Hitting a big ole speed bump.  Luck runs out.  Karma comes calling.  If you’ve been doing shizz you’re not supposed to be doing, it is time to pay your dues.  Don’t gamble with your luck, dude.
23@Justice@No matter what is happening, you can be sure that the universe is playing it fair.  Justice is being done and you need to trust that you are now seeing the results of past actions.  Things are being made “right”.  If you are dealing with legal issues, the outcome will be just.  Situations may call for harmony and balance.  If you are making decisions at this time, weigh all options carefully to find the middle ground.  Do the right thing.  Time to lay down the law.
24@Justice Reversed@Justice delayed is justice denied.  Unfairness.  Getting ripped off.  Feeling oppressed by the court system or “the man”.  Getting caught with your hands in the cookie jar.  Not a good time to be trying to work the system.  Being treated unfairly.  Racial profiling.  Dirty court shenanigans.  Crooked lawyers.  Case delayed.  Best for you to be chilling now until things blow over.
25@The Hanged Man@Now is the time to put things on hold until you can get a better perspective.  Non-action.  A period of waiting may be necessary and wise.  If you don’t like the way things are looking, you may need to look at them differently.  This is also the card of sacrifice, letting go, surrender – what do you need to release?  What are you reading and willing to let go of? Wait it out. Have faith.
26@The Hanged Man Reversed@Holding on for dear life.  Fear of letting go.  Feeling like a victim.  Persecution complex.  If you are adopting these mindsets, your situation will persist.  Only by having the faith to let go can you move past your limitations.  This can also represent being victimized or framed.  Depending on the other cards present, this can indicate finding the courage to let go once and for all.  Stand on your own two feet, fool.  Benedict Arnold.
27@Death@This is a time for endings.  Out with the old and in with the new.  In order for growth to take place, the outworn must be discarded.  A major transition.  A new cycle is ahead.  Release your attachment to what was and welcome the transformation ahead. Death indicates the end is near. It’s all over now, baby blue.
28@The Death Reversed@Holding on for dear life.  A refusal to accept change.  Stuck in a rut.  Limbo.  Should this card show up reversed in your reading, it’s time to reexamine the stagnant spots in your life.  Always remember that the only thing that is unchanging is change.  Move on, let go, it’s over, dawg.
29@The Temperance@It is time to pause on your journey and consider what you have learned thus far.  How are you going to integrate those lessons into your life?  Balance and harmony; finding the middle path.  Temperance is also a gentle reminder to remain patient – allow things to work out the way they need to.  Rather than trying to force an issue, go with the flow.  If you are making any major decisions, weigh your options carefully.
30@The Temperance Reversed@Everything’s zen?  I don’t think so.  Everything is out of whack and it is time for a major adjustment – even if only your attitude.  The energy is all over the place. Disruption.  This card can also indicate doing things to excess ala Liberace.  Pull yourself back to the center.  Lose the bling and seek the real thing.
31@The Devil@ When this card pops up in a reading, you can be assured that things are taking a turn towards the dark and obsessive.  The Devil is about being “stuck” and limited by a situation.  The energy is oppressive and heavy.  This card can represent addiction in the absolute worse sense.  Notice that the chains are loose on the figures – a sign that the situation can change if you want to (or find the courage muscles to let go).  It is also a reminder to check yourself before you wreck yourself – are you allowing envy, greed or negativity to taint your worldview?  Where can you let go a little more?
32@The Devil Reversed@A big ole release!  Bondage, schmondage – now you’re free and able to move about.  The addiction no longer has a hold on you.  Recovery from a bad situation.  Leaving an abusive relationship.  This is the big shift in consciousness from victim to victor.  Liberation, baby!
33@The Tower@The Tower card is a sign that things are about to change – drastically.  This is revolution time, baby. Time to tear all that shit down and start fresh.  Don’t try to resist as this is necessary.  The ground is being razed to prepare for a new foundation.  This card can sometimes indicate violence or a hostile takeover so pay attention to where it shows up in a reading.  Everything is about to shift and when it is all done and the dust settles, peace and enlightenment comes.  Major crown chakra action.
34@The Tower Reversed@The calm before the storm.  A disaster averted.  The energy becomes less intense – more like a small tremor rather than the big earthquake.  Clinging to the realm (Thanks Game of Thrones! Ha!).  If you are holding on, make sure that your reason for doing so is worth it.  Fear of change.  Putting a cap on it.  Chicken Little – the sky is not falling after all.  Stop stressin’, yo.
35@The Star@The Star card represents renewal and hope. This is the healing and peace that takes place after the storm. Optimism is restored and wishes are being fulfilled.  Things are looking up!  Positive vibes.  You can shed your inhibitions and just be authentically you.  Taking center stage. Fame: baby, you’re a star!
36@The Star Reversed@Bummer time.  Debbie Downer.  Hopes diminish and fear takes over.  Depression or illness.  When the Star is reversed, the situation suddenly becomes hopeless.  Stepping back from the limelight.  Fear of being yourself.   Feeling meh…..
37@The Moon@The Moon portends a difficult, unclear path ahead. Things may not be what they seem – therefore, you need to proceed with caution.  There may be unexpected problems and drama, which could complicate matters.  The primary vibe here is anxiety – it may be time to examine your fears.  The dark night of the soul.  Imagination could be rampant – ground yourself and try not to work yourself up in a lather. Watch out for liars and haters.
38@The Moon Reversed@The objectivity you seek finally becomes oh-so-clear as day.  All things come out in the open and you now know what you are working with.  Truth always comes to the surface.  No more hiding – it’s obvious.  Fear has vanished and you can proceed with confidence.  A strong message in your dreams – pay attention to that shit.
39@The Sun@A joyous and happy outcome.  Success at last!  The freedom to enjoy the fruits of your labor.  Celebration and pleasure.  The clouds are lifted and you can proceed with confidence.  Birth of a beloved child.  This is the card I want to see in a reading when I am looking for a positive sign (PS it’s my favorite card in the deck).  Big time recognition.  It is your time to grab that spotlight and run with it, yo.
40@The Sun Reversed@Still a good outcome but less happy happy joy joy – more like a quieter yet still optimistic future.  Delayed gratification.  Having a hard time stepping into that spotlight and taking a bow.  (Could also be someone else taking credit for your stuff!)  If other negative cards surround this, it could indicate sadness.  Bratty kids.
41@Judgment@Judgement indicates you are being called to something greater. Now is the time to let go of the old and rise up!  A major rebirth is possible. This is the end of an important chapter – you are integrating the lessons from that time and seeing the light.  Listen to your conscience and do the right thing.  Taking the high road.  The cosmic wake-up call. An epiphany. Tooting your own horn. A crossroads. Where will you go from here? Consider the paths available. Atonement. A chance to make a change once and for all.
42@Judgment Reversed@A critical error in judgment.  Your perspective is skewed.  You may have lost the ability to be objective or to follow your inner guidance and now you may suffer the consequences from that.  Getting stuck in a rut.  Refusal to hear the call.  Religious fanatics, false prophets and cults.  You may be judged unfairly by some bigot.  Ignore that negation, playa.
43@The World@Congratulations – you have successfully completed a major cycle/mission or lesson!  Your journey is now coming to a conclusion and you’re getting ready for the next chapter.  A feeling of elation and completion.  Your karmic work is done. You’ve reached your goal and it’s all good, baby.  If you’ve been struggling with an issue, closure is now at hand.  A good omen for long-distance travel.  Think globally, act locally.
44@The World Reversed@Limbo time.  You may feel as if things are on hold.  What lesson did you not learn?  What things are unfinished?  Loose ends are dangling. Time to tie that shizz up so that you can move forward.  If you don’t have closure on an issue, you can’t let anything new enter your life.  Unfinished business.  Everything is up in the air.  Travel problems.
45@Ace of Wands@This card is always an omen of good things to come – whether that be a new job, the birth of a child or a fantastic new idea, you can be sure that the Ace of Wands is saying: hell yeah!  Go for it, big time!  A major offer or opportunity.  The dream job.  The proposal.  It’s all good, baby.  The green light you’ve been waiting for has arrived.  You’ve arrived – debut your fine self and own that stage!  This can also indicate the beginning of a hot, sexy relationship.  Ooh la la!  Turning over a new leaf.
46@Ace of Wands Reversed@This is a “hell no” and indicates that things (or you) are not ready to manifest.  Stuff is on hold and you’re gonna need to cool your jets, pal.  Delays.  Getting a rejection notice.  Impotence issues (bummer!).  Force and brutality.  Hard labor.
47@Two of Wands@The Two of Wands is a card of victory. It says: you’re in a great position.  You’ve achieved an important goal and are now ready for the next step.  You have mastered the situation.  You have more than one option available to you.  So what’s next?  Start making plans and putting your road map together.  Planning your next trip. Dominion.  Ruling the world like a boss! Going global.
48@Two of Wands Reeversed@You have to go back and finish what you’ve started.  An unexpected twist may have thrown you off course.  Plans falling apart.  Time to regroup and go with a whole new strategy. Lack of vision, thinking small time. Being out of your comfort zone.  A delay in your trip.  You may be staying home, dawg.
49@Three of Wands@You are now in the perfect position to begin planning your next move.  The Three of Wands signals the possibility for a major expansion. Whether this be taking your career in a new direction or taking over the world, you can begin plotting your next move.  Don’t be thinking small – this card encourages big, epic visions.  The Three of Wands also can suggest an opportunity on the horizon.  That ship you were waiting on is in view.  And if you’re looking to go on some sort of world tour, this card says your plans will work out brilliantly.  Hit the road, Jack!
50@Three of Wands Reversed@Back to the drawing board, dawg. Those plans are not gelling.  It may be that you lack the vision or the support to get things off the ground.  You need to build up more street cred before you take this thang forward.  Delays and setbacks may plague a perfectly good plan or trip.  Seasickness.  Thinking small time.  Can’t be a balla if you thinking like a chump.
51@Four of Wands@I always see this card as a happy omen when it shows up. This is the victory dance at the end of the touchdown, the joy of returning home for the holidays, the sign of a fruitful union, the celebration for a job well done.  Harmony and happiness in all endeavors.  Life is sweet and there are more reasons to celebrate than commiserate.  A triumphant return to the old hood.  A kickback with your closest peeps.
52@Four of Wands Reversed@Still positive but it can indicate leaving home or moving out.  This can also be the surprise party or an event that has a twist to it.  Again, still positive and a sign that stuff is moving ahead, even if a delay to the outcome.  Keep on truckin’ and you’ll be tossing some confetti and throwing back with your crew soon enough.
53@Five of Wands@Be aware of competition but don’t be afraid of it. Power struggles may be brewing.  Opposition to ideals.  A spirited debate or match is good for the soul and will prevent complacency.  Jump into it and give it your all.  Real true playas welcome a good bout and never shy away from it.  Get in the game and show them who da real boss is.  Kicking ass and taking names.  Taking on a bunch of punk-ass bullies.
54@Five of Wands Reversed@The Five of Wands reversed indicates that the struggle comes to an end or someone gives up and walks away.  Cowardice.  Besting the competition.  Grudge match.  Restarting an old conflict – and for what?  The spoils may not go to the victor but to the one who is wise enough to say “enough”. Someone may be trying to jock your fresh – brush your shoulders off and ignore that biter.
55@Six of Wands@Victory is at hand.  You’re getting ready to step into the winner’s circle.  Be sure to thank all the fine supporters who helped you to achieve your goal.  A good leader never forgets their hired guns.  Getting back in the saddle again.  Bossing up.  Moving forward.  Leader of the pack.  Big wins.  You’re a champion, baby – now act like one.
56@Six of Wands Reversed@Everything moves in fits and starts.  Spurting progress.  A retreat from a battle.  Epic fail.  Your support turns around and walks away.  Betrayal from your closest allies.  Plans go sideways. What seemed like an easy win turns out to be a hard-fought battle.  Abandoning ship or a cause. Trojan horse.  The Six of Wands reversed can indicate a fall from grace.
57@Seven of Wands@The Seven of Wands says it’s time to take a stand.  Gather your courage muscles and stand up for what you believe in.  This is about asserting yourself, no matter what the odds may be.  Take a defensive posture.  Push back. If you want to win the battle, you must engage fully.  Keeping the wolves at bay. Fighting the good fight.  Resisting the powers that be.  Rage against the machine. Fight da man!
58@Seven of Wands Reversed@Wussing out. Giving in or giving up.  Getting a beat down.  Losing the will to fight on.  Retreat.  Being overcome by the enemy.  Strong bullies that arrive with reinforcement. Weak boundaries. Fitting in rather than standing out.  Getting in over your head. You let your enemies best your sorry ass.  Win some, lose some. Better luck next time, pal.
59@Eight of Wands@Things are moving at warp speed.  If you have experienced a lull, it’s now full on, baby.  Quick movement.  A whirlwind romance.  Progress at last.  A project is moving forward towards completion.  Important news arrives.  The Eight of Wands is one of the best cards for travel.  If this shows up in your reading, get ready to pack those bags.
60@Eight of Wands Reversed@And progress stalls.  Things begin to move at a crawl. Traffic jams.  Pulling back after some initial progress.  Going on strike.  Filibuster.  Backing out of a situation.  Travel plans cancel.  (Personal note: I once pulled this right before I was supposed to go on a trip.  I sat for three days in the airport.)
61@Nine of Wands@You have learned a big-time lesson and although you are moving on, what is the takeaway from that experience?  Have you done the work to the wound or did you just slap a bandaid on it?  It’s time to move on and make a mental note: don’t do that again.  Lessons learned.  School of hard knocks.  Trust issues.  If you feel someone is trying to salt your game, don’t ignore the vibe.  Watch your back.
62@Nine of Wands@Drop your defenses and stop being a suspicious Aloysius.  If you keep acting like you don’t trust the Universe, you cannot expect results.  The Nine of Wands reversed says: have faith.  Let down your guard.  Isolation ends.  Reopening an old psychic wound.  Don’t be acting so sketch.  Mean muggin’. Throwing shade.  Shifty business.
63@Ten of Wands@The Ten of Wands is about being weighed down with too many responsibilities, hard work or burdens.  Whatever the case may be, your load is heavy-duty.  Hard labor. There is an end in sight but it may be hard to see at this time.  The Ten of Wands is also about oppression.  How are you being held down?  How can you express yourself and stand up for your rights?  Fight the power or be held down by it. Trying to “do it all”.
64@Ten of Wands Reversed@The big release.  Finally saying no to “just one more thing”.  Standing tall in the face of oppression or hate.  Liberation from the oppressor.  Courage in the face of injustice. The goal is reached and you don’t have to be hustling so hard.  Taking a break after a long, hard slog.  Take this job and shove it.
65@Page of Wands@ A new creative beginning awaits.  You’re planting a seed that may grow into something amazing.  Writing, art, music – whatever the medium you choose, this is a good sign that your work will continue to flourish.  The Page of Wands can also represent a fiery and enthusiastic child who loves physical activity and being on the go.  A good student, they may also be a leader amongst their peers.  They may also have a bit of a rebellious streak.  This card can also indicate good news on the way and is a particularly positive omen if you are waiting on a job offer.  An exciting new project, endeavor or passion. The spark of an idea or an attraction.
66@Page of Wands Reversed@Rebel without a cause.  A young person heading down the wrong path.  Slacker.  Immaturity.  Struggling at school.  Gang banger.  Impulsive, rash communication.  Hothead. Bad news.  You may be hearing the very thing you didn’t want to hear.   Dishonesty.  Someone may be pulling your chain.  Lackluster – no spark.
67@Knight of Wands@This fiery fellow is bound to add some real heat and action when he shows up in a tarot reading.  The Knight of Wands is all about pursuing the dream with vigor and enthusiasm.  Move forward with confidence towards your goals.  This is the time for focused and swift action.  The energy is also sexy and very phallic – a sign that your lust is about to get awakened in a big way.  Ready for some steamy nights?  It’s so on, shawty.  Adventure time!
68@Knight of Wands Reversed@All heat but no real fire.  Comes on strong but fades out fast.  Erectile dysfunction.  The passion becomes anger and impulse instead.  Unrestrained lust – can be a cheater.  Thinking with the “other head”.  He’s not that into you. Rebelling for no damn reason at all.  Big talker with nothing to back it up.  Lack of enthusiasm.   Meh.  The fast track to dullsville.
69@Queen of Wands@The Queen of Wands is the keeper of the flame.  She’s confident, strong, courageous and intense.  When this card shows up in a tarot reading, you may be called to embody those qualities.  Are you ready to nurture that creative fire that burns in your belly?  Put your energy into manifesting your dreams.  You have the power to make big things happen, and all it takes is a commitment to your passion.  This card can also represent a feisty and hot woman who’s about to add some heat to a situation.
70@Queen of Wands Reversed@A passion that is waning or dying out.  Lack of care or enthusiasm leads to a big fat nothing.  The energy turns angry and tempestuous.   Or the opposite: no real fire.  Coldness.  A dud.  A hard woman with a bitchy personality.  The Devil wears Prada.  A cocktease.
71@King of Wands@The King of Wands is the master of fire.  This passionate chap is one brave, charismatic ball of hotness.  Super yang.  Macho to the core.  Cocksure.  He’s got swagger and can lead like a real boss. Talks powerfully, carries a big stick.  When this card makes an appearance in your reading, it can indicate that you need to embody the vibration of strong, creative leadership (and a little swerve to your step won’t hurt either).  This card can also indicate a major playa who has all the moves.  If you’re looking to add a little flavor to your game, he may just be the mack daddy you’ve been waiting for. He’s going to bring big-time heat.
72@King of Wands Reversed@The fire is out.  Leadership turns weak – or becomes dictator-like.  Bully.  Lack of manliness.  Erectile dysfunction.  Dude goes from super hot to nothing more than a broke, big-mouthed buster.  Cannot hold up his end of the bargain.  Irresponsibility.  All swag, nothing to back it up.  Shady.  Leading with his other head.  Egomaniac. Sexist bastard. A cheater.
73@Ace of Cups@The Ace of Cups indicates that a romantic offer awaits you.  A new suitor or partnership.  If you are looking for love, it’s very likely that something positive is on the horizon.  Emotionally, this is a time to open yourself up. Be vulnerable and express the softer side of your self (you don’t always have to be a straight-up thug – show that tender side!).  A great card for weddings, proposals, births or any sort of heart-centered celebration. A new emotional beginning. A chance to start fresh. Healing the old to make way for the new.
74@Ace of Cups Reversed@An emotional disappointment.  Perhaps the other person is not feeling the same as you. They may be unavailable emotionally or have commitment issues.  Being turned down.  Rejection. Dissed. Emotional unavailability. Commitment issues. Coldness. Feeling let down and depressed – or blocked.  If this card is combined with the Devil, it can speak of serious addiction issues.   Time to get some intervention in da house.
75@Two of Cups@If you are in the market for love, the Two of Cups indicates that you may be meeting someone soon.  This card can also signify any sort of positive partnership – friendship or even work-related.  It’s all about connecting and coming together to form a healthy and lasting alliance.  Sometimes this card can indicate a wedding or engagement.  Sharing a common goal.  Healing. Meeting halfway.  Compromise.  Engagement.  Romance.  That loving feeling.  Love at first sight. A toast!
76@Two of Cups Reversed@You may be having a hard time seeing eye to eye.  Relationships take a difficult turn. Communication breakdown.  A separation is possible. Perhaps you both want different things at this time?  Something or someone may be coming between you.  Disputes and arguments.  A missed romantic opportunity. Disinterest.  He’s not that into you. Unproductive meetings.
77@Three of Cups@It’s time to celebrate!  Whether you are attending a party or simply celebrating a victory, get the champagne out and live large.  This card can signify a formal celebration like a wedding or an informal girl’s night out.  It can also indicate a circle of support when you really need it.  The Three of Cups is usually a welcome sight in any romantic reading BUT it can also indicate a love triangle if other cards support it (ex: The Devil). A time of joy. Magic rituals.
78@Three of Cups Reversed@The party is over.  Premature celebration.  Getting all drunk ‘n stupid.  You’re going to regret that overindulgence in the morning, pal.  A lack of support at a time when you need it most.  Friends let you down.  Interference from an outside source.  Gossip and bickering.  Someone is running their mouth about your business.
79@Four of Cups@You’ve pulled away to regroup.  Why?  Because what’s in front of you hasn’t been satisfying.  This is a period of contemplation and sorting out the options.  Everything seems stale and boring.  Meh.  Are you unable to see the cool stuff right in front of your face?  Maybe you’re just a malcontent.  Rejecting.  Pushing away help.  Either you’re a bummer or getting all Zen ‘n stuff.
80@Four of Cups Reversed@The Four of Cups reversed suggests a new outlook.  That mental/emotional breakthrough that you needed is at hand. Viola – no more complacency.  You’re getting a big ole sign from the Universe.  It’s like right there.  Stop messing around and act on it.  Getting back in the game after some time away.
81@Five of Cups@You have suffered a loss and are now moving through the grieving process.  The pain is real and you must move through it.  This card is all about deep loss and regret.  The energy here can get stuck in wallow mode.  Can you forgive and move on?  There is something very good on the horizon but if you only choose to look at what you have lost you will never be able to see what you can have.  Put the water under the bridge and start again.
82@Five of Cups Reversed@A whole new emotional outlook is at hand.  It’s time to move on and let that old shizz go.  Recovery time, baby.  You’re ready to get on with your life.  Major healing ahead.  Forgiveness work.
83@Six of Cups@If you are in the market for love, you may be meeting a romantic partner or being courted.  This could be someone new but more often, it’s a suggestion of a blast from the past or someone with whom you are already familiar.  The energy here is about returning to one’s roots.  Whether that be an old love, a former job, or old memories, the past is calling.  The Six of Cups may also indicate that you may be receiving a gift – don’t look that gift horse in the mouth.  Say thank you.
84@Six of Cups Reversed@The energy moves from nostalgia to being hung up on the past.  As in constantly bitching about the present and longing for days gone by.  Those good old days may not be as good as you remember.  It’s time to stop clinging to what was and embrace what is.  Any sort of emotional immaturity, yours or others, will hold you back now.  Man up and stop that b.s.
85@Seven of Cups@You may be dreaming and scheming.  Your head is in the clouds.  This is the card of daydreaming of what could be.  Can you find a way to bring those dreams down to earth and turn them into something tangible? The Seven of Cups can also indicate having many choices before you like a kid in the candy store.  It may be difficult to figure out which is the right one at this time. Don’t make a rash decision.  In a romantic reading, this card can indicate commitment issues.  “I don’t know what I want.”  Too much bling.
86@Seven of Cups Reversed@Things are becoming clear at last.  You now know what actions to take to move your dreams forward.  A choice may be made for you.  On a negative note, this could also indicate the end of a dream; being brought back to cold, hard reality.  Confusion.  An overactive imagination.  Having a hard time sticking to practical matters.
87@Eight of Cups@The Eight of Cups signals that it may be time to move on.  You’ve outgrown the current situation.  Sometimes a playa just needs a new perspective.  What’s on the other side of that mountain? You won’t know by staying in your comfort zone.  Move along, little dogie.  You might be surprised at what you find – or learn about yourself. Going away.  A great card for hitting the road or leaving for a retreat.  (In a negative spread, this can indicate going to prison.)
88@Eight of Cups Reversed@You’re not ready to leave.  You keep going back to the scene of the crime. What lesson are you clinging too?  On the other hand, perhaps it is not time to walk away just yet.  Return to the situation until you fully understand it.  Travel problems.  Having to turn around and go right back home.  The prodigal son (or daughter or wayward lover) returns.
89@Nine of Cups@The Nine of Cups is traditionally known as the “wish fulfillment” card and a good omen that you are going to get exactly what you want.  Make a wish! Of course, ever the practical sage, I like to add: be specific and careful because the Universe is listening, yo.  This card also speaks of feeling satisfied and comfortable.  You got what you need around you – and then some.  Be grateful because you are sitting oh-so-pretty at this moment.
90@Nine of Cups Reversed@The energy goes from satisfaction to over indulgence.  Suddenly, nothing is enough and you’re going all Gordon Gecko greedy.  Smugness. Party animal.  Overdoing things.  Excess.  Weight gain (consequences on all that extravagance).   Wishes unfulfilled.  Or you got what you want and it turned out to be not so great.  Buyer’s remorse (or wisher’s remorse!). Laziness.
91@Ten of Cups@Pleasure and happiness.  This card indicates that life is looking good, particularly in domestic and family matters. There are many reasons to celebrate now – even if only the simple joy of being with your loved ones.  Support is present if you need it.  Whether this is for your home or work, the energy is “one big ole merry ‘n harmonious family”.  This card can also indicate a perfect wrap up to a situation.  Parties, celebrations, family reunions.  Break out the bubbly and enjoy the upbeat vibe.
92@Ten of Cups Reversed@Family troubles create a crack in the foundation.  Squabbles and disagreements make for a hellish home environment.  The end of a good situation.  Disintegration of support.  One of those icky family gatherings with the people you want to see the least.  The empty nest.  The family from hell.  Putting the fun in dysfunction.
93@Page of Cups@The Page of Cups can indicate a love message or romantic proposal may be coming your way.  Someone is ready to express their feelings openly.  Someone wants to be your boo. Reach out and touch someone.  New love.  Who’s crushing on you? A much wanted and very loved child may play an important role in the situation.
94@Page of Cups Reversed@Romance without maturity.  A flirtation that doesn’t go far.  Emotionally infantile or naive.  Codependence. Getting a “Dear John” letter.  Rejection.  Let that sucka go and move on.  Experimenting with substances.  A spoiled brat.
95@Knight of Cups@The Knight of Cups is the Prince Charming, the “knight in shining armor” that sweeps you off your feet in a romantic gesture.  He’s sensitive, empathic and perhaps a bit of a dreamer.  A consummate gentleman, he is proof that chivalry is not dead.  This card can also be a reminder to let your heart lead your decisions.  Follow your deepest dreams. Go on a romantic adventure!
96@Knight of Cups Reversed@Prince Charming turns out to be a cad.  An irresponsible, immature or emotionally unavailable person.  An inability to connect with the feelings.  Deception and manipulation.  He appears seductive but on closer inspection, he’s a buster.  Alcohol or drug abuse.  Take a pass on this one unless you enjoy enabling ‘n drama.
97@Queen of Cups@The Queen of Cups is the feminine ideal – soft and sensitive, she is deeply nurturing.  She has a strong connection to her intuition and most of her decisions are made from the heart.  She can express her feelings easily – both good and bad.   A softie. This card can represent a woman in your life with those qualities or it can indicate energies that you are bringing to a situation.  Tune into your feelings and let them guide you.  Your “boo”.
98@Queen of Cups Reversed@A moody, whiny beyotch.  Big time melodrama.  A hot emotional mess. Clingy and yucky.  Baby mama drama.  Being completely out of touch with your feelings or everyone else’s.  Hysteria.  If you are looking for a delusional fatal attraction type, you found ‘er.  Addiction issues or codependence.
99@King of Cups@I often refer to this card as the “King of Love” when he comes up in a reading.  The King of Cups is the ultimate romantic ideal – caring, nurturing, patient and loving.  He’s the type of guy who makes great husband and father material.  You can also bet that he’ll be giving you his whole heart, ‘cause he’s a lover, not a fighter.  This guy is a real softie.  This card can also indicate that you adapt the qualities of this card: be sensitive, loving and nurturing.  Like a “love boss”.
100@King of Cups Reversed@Mr. Sulky is in da house.  Love turns cold or whiny and your King of Love becomes a pouty, dishonest jerk.  Big time drama, amplified.  Emotional vampire – or emotionally unavailable.  This can be a signal of addiction issues, especially when combined with the Devil.  Emotionally abusive.  A wussy.
101@Ace of Swords@This is the big time mental breakthrough that you’ve been waiting for.  The air clears and you see the light at last.  The “aha” moment.

Dishonesty; speaking with a forked tongue.  Fighting unfairly.  All promises, no follow through.  Wussing out. Loss of the battle (and your street cred).  Stick a fork in it, you’re done.
103@Two of Swords@The path ahead may not be clear at this time. You need more time and space to weigh out your options.  The answer you seek will come after more reflection.  This is not the time to take bold action – instead, sit with your situation for a bit until you have a better sense of what needs to be done.  Timeout.  Emotional blockages.  Vision problems.  An inability to make a decision.  The middle ground.  Keeping the peace. Trying to be all like Switzerland ‘n stuff.
104@Two of Swords Reversed@The Two of Swords reversed indicates that the wait is over and action resumes.  You are able to see exactly what needs to be done.  Absolute clarity.  No second guessing.  Movement at last.  Seeing the light.  A decision may be made for you.  Getting off your ass and making stuff happen.  A lighter load.  Taking sides.

A good card for travel or any sort of movement.  Sadness passing, healing ahead.  Don’t look back, dawg.  Burn rubber.

Making the same mistake again.  Lack of clarity.  Moving or travel drama.  Traffic jam. Coming back.  The not-so-triumphant return.  Your support or lack thereof may be undermining your growth.  Chuck those fools who are holding you back.
113@Seven of Swords@Taking shizz that don’t belong to you.  This is the card of thieving, conniving, and sneaky actions. Copycats and biters.  Bullshitters.  Rip-offs and con games.  Criminal activity.  Are you trying to get away with something you know you shouldn’t be doing?

125@Queen of Swords@The Queen of Swords is the feminine thought leader.  She is quick-witted, intellectual, and clear-sighted.  She is ruled by logic, not her heart. That does not mean that she’s heartless, she simply wants to make sure that things make sense.  A keen judge, she is always about what is fair.  When this card shows up in your reading, you may be called to embody those characteristics.  This can sometimes manifest as criticism and bluntness.
